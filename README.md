# Bot_AI React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Requirements:
Goal is to implement an application where the user can chat with an AI model. Beyond
this, the user should be able to give some feedback at each stage of the conversation.


### features
The user should be able to toggle between light and dark mode.

The user is able to like/dislike the AI model's answer using the thumbs up/thumbs down buttons.

These buttons are hidden and float when the mouse hovers over the AI model's response.

The user can give a rating out of 5 at the end of the conversation.

The user can give subjective feedback at the end of the conversation.

The can do multiple such conversations.

Once the user is done having that conversation, the chat gets saved.

This chat can be
revisited from a panel on the side/top bar.

While viewing a past conversation, the user
should also be able to see the feedback provided.
